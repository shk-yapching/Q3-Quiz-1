                    A formulaic basic action movie which is a bit of a ripoff of Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning. There were some good aspects of the movie, particularly the first half was pretty good and the fight scenes were pretty decent as well. Gal Gadot is charming as always, Jamie Dornan is good as well, but Alia Bhatt's acting is terrible.Overall, not that bad as one would expect from Netflix, but also nothing groundbreaking. Good enough for when you just want to watch an action flick.

                    Two FBI agent brothers, Marcus and Kevin Copeland, accidentally foil a drug bust. As punishment, they are forced to escort a pair of socialites to the Hamptons, where they're going to be used as bait for a kidnapper. But when the girls realize the FBI's plan, they refuse to go. Left without options, Marcus and Kevin decide to pose as the sisters, transforming themselves from African-American men into a pair of blonde, white women.
